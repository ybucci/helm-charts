* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Mude a versão do helm chart por favor e faça o push"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Updated Chart.yaml to version 2.0.2 while keeping appVersion at 2.0.1"

### Checkpoint: 1f9bdd6 - Controller Fix for CrashLoopBackOff
* **GIT SHA:** `1f9bdd6c8a6d2728c8e285e404229485e345fff0`
* **Commit Message:** `FIX: Added main thread keep-alive loop to prevent controller from exiting`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed the CrashLoopBackOff issue with the controller by adding a main thread keep-alive loop. The controller was exiting immediately after startup because the main thread was completing its execution. Added a continuous loop in the main thread to keep the process running.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Está com algum erro, por favor tente identificar o que está ocorrendo"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified that the controller was exiting immediately after startup and added a main thread keep-alive loop to prevent it from exiting"

### Checkpoint: 1bed580 - Dockerfile and Kopf Initialization Fix
* **GIT SHA:** `1bed580d137d841382fd7db6c8cc75b51e8cac2e`
* **Commit Message:** `FIX: Corrected Kopf initialization and main function structure`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed the root cause of the CrashLoopBackOff issue. The problem was in the Dockerfile and how Kopf was being initialized. Restructured the controller to use a proper main() function with kopf.run() instead of the previous approach. This ensures the controller runs properly and stays alive.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Será algum problema no dockerfile talvez ?"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified the Dockerfile issue and restructured the controller with proper Kopf initialization using kopf.run() in a main function. Built and pushed version 2.0.3 of the image and updated chart to version 2.0.4"

### Checkpoint: 566f6fc - Kopf User Detection Fix
* **GIT SHA:** `566f6fc677d0d5bcbb6f51036e099ce4f982c49c`
* **Commit Message:** `FIX: Resolved Kopf user detection issue with KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed the 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1000' error by setting KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable to avoid user detection issues. Also improved the Dockerfile to create a proper user with home directory. The controller now starts successfully without user-related errors.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Agora mudou o erro, analise por favor"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Analyzed the new error (uid not found: 1000), identified it as a Kopf user detection issue, and fixed it by setting KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable. Built and pushed version 2.0.4 of the image and updated chart to version 2.0.5"

### Checkpoint: af80592 - KOPF_IDENTITY Environment Variable in Deployment
* **GIT SHA:** `af80592`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Fixed - Add KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable to deployment template`
* **Notes/Observations:** Added KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable directly to the deployment template to ensure it's properly set in the Kubernetes environment. The previous fix was only in the Python code but the environment variable wasn't being passed to the container. Updated chart version to 2.0.6.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Mesmo erro"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified that KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable wasn't being set in the deployment template, added it directly to the deployment.yaml, and updated chart version to 2.0.6"

### Checkpoint: c16e403 - Dockerfile Root User Fix
* **GIT SHA:** `c16e403`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Fixed - Modified Dockerfile to run as root and avoid user detection issues`
* **Notes/Observations:** Changed approach by modifying the Dockerfile to run as root user instead of creating a non-root user. This completely avoids the user detection issue that Kopf was encountering. Removed user creation code and set KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable in the Dockerfile. Local testing confirmed the fix works - no more user detection errors. Updated to image version 2.0.5 and chart version 2.0.7.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Ainda contiua com erro, consegue tentar mudar a abordagem talvez do dockerfile"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Modified Dockerfile to run as root, removed user creation code, added KOPF_IDENTITY environment variable, built and pushed version 2.0.5, and updated chart to version 2.0.7. Local testing showed the user detection error was resolved."

### Checkpoint: 30ab4f2 - Values.yaml Configuration Fix
* **GIT SHA:** `30ab4f2`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Fixed - Updated values.yaml with correct image tag and root security context`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed the root cause of why the deployment was still using the old image - the values.yaml file still had tag "2.0.4" instead of "2.0.5". Also updated the security context to match the root user approach: changed runAsNonRoot to false, runAsUser to 0, runAsGroup to 0, and fsGroup to 0. Updated chart version to 2.0.8. This should finally resolve the deployment issue.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Acho que vc não alterou o valor default do values"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified that values.yaml still had the old image tag 2.0.4 and conflicting security context settings. Updated image tag to 2.0.5, changed security context to run as root (user 0), and updated chart to version 2.0.8."

### Checkpoint: 3e7bd69 - Controller Logic Fix for Load Balancer Type
* **GIT SHA:** `3e7bd69`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Fixed - Removed automatic traefik.io/load-balancer-type annotation to prevent override of explicit configurations`
* **Notes/Observations:** Identified and fixed the root cause of why all IngressRoutes were being set to "internal". The controller was automatically adding the `traefik.io/load-balancer-type` annotation with the determined service type, which then became an explicit configuration that overrode the priority logic in subsequent runs. Removed this automatic annotation to allow the priority-based logic to work correctly. Updated to image version 2.0.6 and chart version 2.0.9.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Acho que o seu codigo que adicionou esse annotation"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Analyzed the code and found that line 220 in update_ingress_route was automatically adding traefik.io/load-balancer-type annotation, creating a feedback loop. Removed this line to fix the priority logic and allow proper service type determination."

### Checkpoint: e193396 - Default Service Configuration Enhancement
* **GIT SHA:** `e193396`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Enhanced - Replaced priority-based logic with default service configuration`
* **Notes/Observations:** Enhanced the controller logic to use a more intuitive `default: true/false` configuration instead of priority numbers. When no specific annotations match an IngressRoute, the controller now uses the service marked as `default: true`. This makes the configuration more explicit and easier to understand. Updated the example configuration and set external as the default service. Updated to image version 2.0.7 and chart version 2.1.0.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Ao invés de usar prioridade talvez seja melhor na config colocarmos um definição default = true ou algo do tipo, ou seja, casa não tenha nenhuma anotação ele sempre vai para o default"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Replaced priority-based logic with default service configuration. Modified determine_service_type function to look for 'default: true' instead of priority numbers. Updated values.yaml with new configuration format and set external service as default."

### Checkpoint: 7f691d4 - RBAC Permissions Fix for Kopf Framework
* **GIT SHA:** `7f691d4`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Fixed - Added CRD discovery permissions for Kopf framework`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed APIForbiddenError where the controller was unable to list customresourcedefinitions in the apiextensions.k8s.io API group. Added the necessary permissions to the ClusterRole for Kopf framework to discover available CRDs in the cluster. This resolves the error: "customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io is forbidden". Updated chart version to 2.1.1.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Parece que está funcionando, porém está gerando alguma log de erro: Request attempt #9/9 failed; escalating: GET https://10.100.0.1:443/apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions -> APIForbiddenError"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified that the ServiceAccount lacked permissions for customresourcedefinitions. Added apiextensions.k8s.io API group with customresourcedefinitions resource and get/list/watch verbs to the ClusterRole. Updated chart version to 2.1.1."
