* **GIT SHA:** `38251ff`
* **Commit Message:** `DOCS: Added manifest.md with API version update documentation`
* **Notes/Observations:** Created documentation/manifest.md to track development progress according to the Git-powered memory methodology. This establishes the foundation for future checkpoint tracking.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Faça os commits necessários e o push"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Created manifest.md file, committed changes, and pushed both commits to origin/main successfully"

### Checkpoint: 2f42f8b - Manifest Updated
* **GIT SHA:** `2f42f8b`
* **Commit Message:** `DOCS: Updated manifest with second checkpoint documentation`
* **Notes/Observations:** Updated manifest.md with complete checkpoint documentation for the API version update process.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Faça os commits necessários e o push"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Updated manifest with checkpoint documentation and pushed to origin/main"

### Checkpoint: Build Complete - Docker Image v2.0.0 Built and Pushed
* **GIT SHA:** `e173681`
* **Commit Message:** `DOCS: Updated manifest with Docker build v2.0.0 checkpoint`
* **Notes/Observations:** Successfully built and pushed Docker image v2.0.0 with the new Traefik API version. Image includes all API updates and is ready for deployment. Built both versioned (2.0.0) and latest tags.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Agora faça o build e push da nova versão"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Built Docker image ybucci/traefik-external-dns-controller:2.0.0 and pushed to DockerHub with both 2.0.0 and latest tags"

### Checkpoint: d406f78 - Single Replica Enforcement and Documentation
* **GIT SHA:** `d406f78`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Enhanced - Single replica enforcement with validation and documentation`
* **Notes/Observations:** Enhanced controller with proper single replica enforcement. Added Helm validation that prevents deployment with multiple replicas, comprehensive documentation about HA limitations, and code comments explaining the architecture decisions. Changed deployment strategy to Recreate and updated Chart version to 2.0.1.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Ele suporta multiplas replicas ? Acho que talvez seja melhor fixar ele só com 1 pod certo ?"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Analyzed controller architecture, identified lack of leader election and race condition issues, implemented validation to prevent multiple replicas, added comprehensive documentation, and updated deployment strategy for single replica operation"

### Checkpoint: 6d5279d - Simplified Single Replica Implementation
* **GIT SHA:** `6d5279d`
* **Commit Message:** `AI: Simplified - Fixed replicas to 1 in deployment template`
* **Notes/Observations:** Simplified the approach by removing complex validation logic and directly setting replicas: 1 in the deployment template. This is cleaner and more straightforward than the previous validation approach. Removed unnecessary replicaCount from values.yaml and cleaned up all related documentation and comments.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Ao invés disso tudo, apenas sete direto no deployment 1 replica"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Removed complex validation logic, set replicas: 1 directly in deployment.yaml template, cleaned up values.yaml and documentation, and simplified the overall approach"

### Checkpoint: Build Complete - Docker Image v2.0.1 Built and Pushed
* **GIT SHA:** `0077066`
* **Commit Message:** `DOCS: Updated manifest with Docker build v2.0.1 checkpoint`
* **Notes/Observations:** Successfully built and pushed Docker image v2.0.1 with the simplified single replica implementation. Image includes all code simplifications and clean deployment template. Built both versioned (2.0.1) and latest tags.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Faça o build e push"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Built Docker image ybucci/traefik-external-dns-controller:2.0.1 and pushed to DockerHub with both 2.0.1 and latest tags"

### Checkpoint: e103521 - Fixed Probe Configuration
* **GIT SHA:** `e103521`
* **Commit Message:** `FIX: Corrected probe configuration in deployment template`
* **Notes/Observations:** Fixed an issue with the liveness and readiness probes in the deployment template. The previous implementation was incorrectly rendering the probe configuration with the 'enabled' field included. Updated the template to explicitly set each probe parameter instead of using toYaml, ensuring proper rendering without the 'enabled' field.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Acho que ta com algum problema nos probes"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Identified and fixed probe configuration in deployment.yaml by explicitly setting each parameter instead of using toYaml"

### Checkpoint: 47d54da - Chart Version Update
* **GIT SHA:** `47d54da`
* **Commit Message:** `CHORE: Bumped chart version to 2.0.2`
* **Notes/Observations:** Updated the Helm chart version to 2.0.2 to reflect the probe configuration fix. The appVersion remains at 2.0.1 since the container image hasn't changed.
* **AI Interaction**:
    * **My Prompt to AI:** "Mude a versão do helm chart por favor e faça o push"
    * **AI Action/Result:** "Updated Chart.yaml to version 2.0.2 while keeping appVersion at 2.0.1"
